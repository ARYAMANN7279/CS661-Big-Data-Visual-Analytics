# CS661-Data-Visualisation-and-Analytics
This repository showcases the two assignments and one course project completed as part of the course CS661 â€“ Data Visualization and Analytics, offered under the guidance of Prof. Soumya Dutta.

Throughout these works, I have employed a range of Python libraries and explored core data visualization principles, including advanced techniques such as t-SNE, to analyze and present data effectively.
